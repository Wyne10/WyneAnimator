## Creating animation

To create an animation you have to add a "WAnimator" component to any GameObject. After that you need to open the animation editor:

You will see a window where you can add and delete animations:

The animation element looks like this:

Here you must select the animation condition (OnTrigger condition must be called manually by using TriggerAnimations(string triggerName) method in WAnimator):

Then you have to pass a condition object (object that being used to check condition) and animated component (component that will be animated). Animator will parse all the __PUBLIC WRITABLE PROPERTIES AND PUBLIC FIELDS__ of component and show you something like this:

If you open one of these values, you can change its animation parameters, all used values will be animated when when the condition is met:

Also, used values will be highlighted in blue:
